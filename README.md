# Welcome to your onboarding guide tool for healthcare project

## Project info

To demonstrate the feasibility and real-world application of the proposed Progressive Learning Model (PLM) for onboarding and in-app guidance, we developed a prototype decentralized healthcare application named HealthVerse. This dApp leverages blockchain technology to enhance healthcare record management, patient autonomy, and data security, while also incorporating the full spectrum of the PLM framework for an adaptive and user-centric onboarding experience.

6.1 Onboarding Guide Breakdown
The HealthVerse onboarding guide was carefully crafted to operationalize the core components of PLM. It aims to reduce the entry barrier for new users—particularly those unfamiliar with dApps—by providing an interactive, personalized, and skill-building onboarding journey.

Step 1: Welcome Screen
The first point of contact presents the core value proposition of HealthVerse, emphasizing:

A personalized user journey

An interactive application tour

Access to a hands-on demo account

User Options:

Start the guided onboarding process

Skip onboarding for direct access

Step 2: Skill Assessment (Assessment Screen)
A machine learning-inspired assessment model evaluates the user’s prior knowledge and comfort with:

Blockchain technology

Experience with healthcare dApps

Cryptocurrency wallet use

Existing health record management methods

Outcomes:

Classifies users as Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced

Tailors subsequent content and interactions based on user type

Step 3: Virtual Tour (TourScreen)
Users are guided through an animated, contextual interface tour that explains:

Main dashboard features

Appointment scheduling

Health monitoring tools

Prescription management

Wellness program tracking

Health records access

Features:

Tooltips, pop-up messages, and guided walkthroughs

Progress bar for navigation

Option to skip or revisit

Step 4: Demo Account (DemoScreen)
Users interact with a fully functional demo version of HealthVerse that includes:

Pre-populated data

Guided video tutorials and walkthroughs

Interactive access to core functionalities such as:

Scheduling appointments

Reviewing digital health records

Managing prescriptions

Learning Tools:

Animated explanations

YouTube-linked resources

Real-time feature simulation

Step 5: Completion and Personalization
After completing onboarding:

Users receive a summary of their progress

Interface and support options are customized based on assessed skill level

Users are seamlessly directed into the main application

Step 6: Feedback Survey
To ensure continual improvement, users complete a brief survey assessing:

Usefulness of the onboarding journey

Clarity and pacing of instructions

Overall user satisfaction

6.2 Technical Architecture
Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS

State Management: React Context API

Routing: React Router

Animations: Framer Motion

UI Library: Shadcn/UI

Blockchain Integration: (To be implemented in the final phase)

6.3 Key Differentiators
Personalized Learning Path: Adjusts to each user’s prior experience and knowledge

Interactive and Visual Engagement: Virtual tours and video demonstrations facilitate understanding

Secure Blockchain Backend: Ensures data integrity and privacy

Real-Time Support: AI-based chatbot (to be trained on onboarding materials) provides contextual help throughout the user journey

This prototype serves as a working proof-of-concept for the proposed PLM and provides valuable insights into designing intuitive, adaptive, and effective onboarding solutions for decentralized healthcare ecosystems.
